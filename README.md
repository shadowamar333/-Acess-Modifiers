# Acess-Modifiers

This is just an overview about acess control and acess modifiers in cadence in flow block chain.this is just and informative program to give simple overview about what are the different acess modifiers used in cadence and what are the advantage and disadvantage of one above another

## Description

in this project we will discuss about different acess modifiers which is used in variables and functions and how are they different from other acess modifiers,each modifier has its own scope in which they can be called or read and modified we will go through them using simple example code

Mainly there are 4 types of acess modifiers we are talking
which are :
* pub(set)           reading scope:All Scope                                            writing scope:All Scope

* pub                reading scope:All Scope                                            writing scope:current & inner

* acess(contract)    reading scope:containing contract,current & inner                  writing scope:current & inner

* acess(self)        reading scope:current & inner                                      writing scope:current & inner

## Getting Started

### Installing

* the example program file is attached to the repository where you can copy or download the file and paste in any cadence running enviornment i prefere to use flow playground
* there are two files which you need to download which are contract and script so paste them in respective window of flow playground

### Executing program

* you can run the program by simply deploying the contract and then executing the script
* you can check each acess modifiers scope by typing the code of function in script or inside the contract 
```
deploy the contract and then execute the script
```

## Help

as this is for understanding which are the access modifiers and how each of them work uniqely you can adjust the code your self and check each cases in acess modifiers in case if ther is some doubt emrges feel free to contact on email given below :
